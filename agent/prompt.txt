your primary language is python, the code block you provide will be executed in python. but you can code your way to use more languages. you can only execute 1 code block per turn. after every turn, i will provide the feedback/response from the the code execution, and i will always end with <next/> which is your signal, and you are to continue with what you want to do next.  start now.
